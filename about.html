		<strong>Lean Six Sigma DMAIC- ZS2 module direct dispatch from vendor</strong><br>
		Associated with ABB<br>
		January'2021 - February'2022<br>
		<br>
		Problem Statement and Scope:<br>
		Multiple handling involved in ZS2 module from receipt to dispatch.<br>
		ZS2 module is first unloaded at dock by store person and it is placed in FG area which is again moved to dock by dispatch person once dispatch is planned. Unloading activity takes average 15 man-minutes per module and once dispatch is planned, loading activity take average 10 man-minutes which accounts to an average of 25 man-minutes of handling activity per module.<br>
		Hence we planned to arrange ZS2 module dispatch from vendor end to avoid the handling and optimize space of FG area.<br>
		<br>
		Project Objective & Benefits to internal/external customer:<br>
		1. Reduction in vehicle movement by 50% and dock occupancy by 100% for every module dispatched from Vendor.<br>
		2. Increased ITO by dispatching ZS2 module without even holding the inventory for a day.<br>
		3. Time saving of 25 man-minutes per module in handling with an average of 75 module receipt per month.<br>
		4. Space optimization at ABB.</br>
